## 🛍️ Mall Customers Segmentation using K-Means Clustering 
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to analyze customer behavior based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score and group customers into meaningful segments using K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique.

Understanding these segments helps businesses design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
